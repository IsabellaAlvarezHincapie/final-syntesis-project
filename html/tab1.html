<h5>Electric energy</h5>
<p>
  is the power an atom´s changed partides have to cause an action to move and
  object. The movement of electrons from one atom´s to other is what results in
  electrical energy.

<h5>Watt</h5>
<p>
  The standard unit of power in the international system of units (SI), equal to
  the power in a circuit in with current of on ampere flows across a potencial
  difference of one volt.
</p>

<h5>Scatter plot</h5>
<p>
  A Scatter plot uses dots to represents values for two different numeric
  variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis
  indicates values for an individual data point.
</p>

<h5>Linear regression</h5>
<p>
  Is a model of the relationship between two things for predictive analysis. In
  which one is dependent and the other is independent.
</p>

<h5>Renewable energy</h5>
<p>
  Renewable energy is energy from natural sources that are replenished at a
  higher rate than ther are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such
  sources that are constantly being replenished.
